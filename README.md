# Bioinfo-algos
This repository contains simplified versions of core bioinformatics algorithms. To be updated:
1) Needleman-Wunsch algorithm - determines similarity between two randomly generated nucleotide sequence
2) Hidden Markov Model - determines likelihood of coding/noncoding regions based on given nucleotide sequence (adds to 'CGAAAAAAATCG' to prove it works)
3) Burrows-Wheeler Algorithm - using data transformation and pattern matching to find randomly sampled reads from randomly sampled nucleotide sequences
