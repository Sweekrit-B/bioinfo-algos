# Bioinfo-algos
This repository contains simplified versions of core bioinformatics algorithms. To be updated:
1) Needleman-Wunsch algorithm - determines similarity between two randomoly generated nucleotide sequence
2) Hidden Markov Model - determines likelihood of coding/noncoding regions based on given nucleotide sequence (adds to 'CGAAAAAAATCG' to prove it works)
